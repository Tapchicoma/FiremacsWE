# FiremacsWE
Firemacs as a Web Extension

## Status
FiremacsWE is not ready to use. The Quantum update broke the API upon which the old version depended. The Web Extensions API is not as friendly to complete remapping of the keyboard to put it mildly. The absence of a Firemacs equivalent for Chome is probably evidence of htis.

### Goals
1. Emacs-like keybindings for editing text.
2. Tab manipulation compatible with the original Firemacs
3. Works in Firefox and Chromium/Chrome

### Development
+ The simpelest useful thing that might work.
+ Eat the elephant one bite at a time.
+ Minimize dependencies.

### To contribute:
0. Use Forking and Pull requests
1. Fork this repository to your personal Github repository

### Please
+ Try to keep the Pull Requests small so that Merges are less likely to be complex.
+ Strongly consider putting your changes in a branch that is not Master.
+ Test in Firefox and Chrome/Chromium
