Permission	Description
"activeTab"	Requests that the extension be granted permissions according to the activeTab specification.
"alarms"	Gives your extension access to the chrome.alarms API.
"background"	Makes Chrome start up early and and shut down late, so that apps and extensions can have a longer life. When any installed hosted app, packaged app, or extension has "background" permission, Chrome runs (invisibly) as soon as the user logs into their computerâ€”before the user launches Chrome. The "background" permission also makes Chrome continue running (even after its last window is closed) until the user explicitly quits Chrome. Note: Disabled apps and extensions are treated as if they aren't installed. You typically use the "background" permission with a background page, event page or (for hosted apps) a background window.
